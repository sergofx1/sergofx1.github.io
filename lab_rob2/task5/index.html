    <h1>Don't be afraid to be &#x0003C; then a 100% success &#x00026; &#x0003E; </h1>
    <p>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.<br> 
        The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;<br>
         who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; <br>
        who spends himself in a worthy cause;<br>
         who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,<br>
          so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."</p>
